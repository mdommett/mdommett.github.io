    Getting to grips with MySQL

</div>

            <div class="markdown">
                <p>Over the last few months I have been using MySQL to locally archive, store, and access data for a few of my projects. Previously, I was using Excel for this purpose, but I have come to find it less than ideal, mainly due to its clunkiness and the fact that I got into bad habits (no vesion control, poor formatting, rudimentary analyses). As such, I decided to switch to a combination of MySQL and python with pandas.</p>

<p>The data I am analysing come from a variety of test files outputs, namely electronic structure codes <a href="gaussian.com">Gaussian</a>, <a href="http://www.turbomole.com/">Turbomole</a>, and <a href="http://www.molcas.org/">Molcas</a>. I am interested in studying the relaxation mechanisms in molecular rotors, in particular the non-radiative decay via intersystem-crossings. However, the exact application is not the focus here, more the process in data extraction and analysis.</p>

<p>First I needed to design my database; I used a column for each spin state and geometry, and level of theory, resulting in 21 columns. Each feature would be a molecular system at a given level of theory.</p>

<p>All of the data can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mdommett/mysql_example">this</a> github repository. I wrote a python script <code>fill_db.py</code>, which mined each output file and iteratively filled in each table. Important here was a naming convention for the output files (24 in total), so I could loop and populate the table. Each function in <code>fill_db.py</code> is specifically for a type of output file (Gaussian, Turbomole&hellip;) and type of data to be extracted (energy type). As such, <code>fill_db.py</code> is very specific for the current task, and has limited scope. However, its still useful as a proof of concept for the workflow - especially for communicating between python and MySQL.</p>

<p>Once the database is filled, I use pandas in Jupyter to analyse the data. An exemplar notebook can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mdommett/mysql_example">repository</a>, where I show how to read in the database, convert it to a pandas dataframe, and produce some plots. I am mostly interested in comparing different features (methods), which the database allows well. Once converted to a dataframe in pandas, I can then append new data directly to the dataframe in the notebook, before adding directly to the SQL database if need be. Have a browse and let me know if you have any questions.</p>
