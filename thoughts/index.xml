      <description>A happy new year to one and all. Over the Christmas holidays I had crack at my first Kaggle competition. Kaggle host competitions based around machine learning. The premise: they provide a data set, you must build a model and predict an outcome.
The competition I took part in, whilst filled to the brim with turkey, mince pies, and costco millionaire shortbread traybake which is honestly the nicest thing in the world and worth a costco membership alone, uses data from the sinking of the Titanic.</description>

      <description>Over the last few months I have been using MySQL to locally archive, store, and access data for a few of my projects. Previously, I was using Excel for this purpose, but I have come to find it less than ideal, mainly due to its clunkiness and the fact that I got into bad habits (no vesion control, poor formatting, rudimentary analyses). As such, I decided to switch to a combination of MySQL and python with pandas.</description>

      <description>At the end of 2016, Rachel Crespo-Otero and I received news that our submitted manuscript was to be published in the journal Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics. It was a great piece of news to receive before the Christmas holidays and was met with both joy and relief. It was the culmination of 12 months of work - the manuscript had taken many guises before we were happy enough to submit. This was my first scientific publication and in this post I want to give some background into the project, how we approached the problem, and the process of publishing in a peer-reviewed academic journal.</description>
