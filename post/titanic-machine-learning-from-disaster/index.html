    Titanic: machine learning from disaster

                <p>A happy new year to one and all. Over the Christmas holidays I had crack at my first <a href="www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> competition. Kaggle host competitions based around machine learning. The premise: they provide a data set, you must build a model and predict an outcome.</p>

<p>The competition I took part in, whilst filled to the brim with turkey, mince pies, and costco millionaire shortbread traybake which is honestly the nicest thing in the world and worth a costco membership alone, is based on James Cameron&rsquo;s  <em>Titanic</em>, an epic disaster film where a fictional cruiseliner sinks after hitting an iceberg. You are given a set of 891 passengers, some characteristics (passenger class, ticket price, age, gender etc) and whether they survived or not. Based on this, you must build a binary classification model which is able to predict if a passenger survives or dies based on their characteristics.</p>

<p>I used python (pandas and scikitlearn libraries) with a Jupyter notebook to do my analysis and build the models. I did all of my initital analysis in <a href="https://github.com/mdommett/titanic/blob/master/Initial.ipynb">this</a> notebook, and my final submission is <a href="https://github.com/mdommett/titanic/blob/master/Final.ipynb">here</a>. The final notebook contains just code, whist the initial is annotated with my thought process, contains charts and plots and is much more detailed.</p>

<p>It was a really fun experience and I certainly learned a lot in a short space of time. I have been using pandas for a while and its power always impresses me. I also found the range and ease of application of the binary classifiers within scikitlearn to be extremely useful. In my attempts I only used algorithms for which I am familiar from a mathematical standpoint. In future competitions, after some reading, I will definitely expand into more complex models.</p>

<p>The hardest part, and where I believe my models lose accuracy, involves the passengers ages. In the train data set, not all of the ages of the passengers are known. As such, in order to include <em>age</em> in the final model, some gaps must be filled. After playing with linear regression (terribly), I decided to bin the ages into bands and used random forests (RF) to predict the age band. I then randomly assigned the age from the predicted age band based on a gaussian distribtion. This process could defnitely be improved, as the RF model wasn&rsquo;t particulary accurate on unseen data. In future, I think I would assign the mean age of the band and more parameter analysis to refine the age model.</p>

<p>So, how did I do? Well, run the notebooks and submit the predictions! Loljk - the model in the first notebook had an accuracy of 77% for the test data, and my second submission scored a marginally better 78%. Room for improvement, but a decent score. In closing, I am just glad that now we have the sense to never again cry &ldquo;full steam ahead!&rdquo; in a foolish endeavour regardless of warnings of danger,treachary and the likely suffering for all but the top percentage of society. <a href="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Theresa-May-and-money-around-city-of-London-721875.jpg">O not&hellip;</a></p>
