      <description>At the end of 2016, Rachel Crespo-Otero and I received news that our submitted manuscript was to be published in the journal Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics. It was a great piece of news to receive before the Christmas holidays and was met with both joy and relief. It was the culmination of 12 months of work - the manuscript had taken many guises before we were happy enough to submit. This was my first scientific publication and in this post I want to give some background into the project, how we approached the problem, and the process of publishing in a peer-reviewed academic journal.</description>
